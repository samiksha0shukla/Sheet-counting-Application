# Sheet-counting-Application

The Sheet Counter Project is an innovative computer vision application designed to accurately count the number of sheets in a stack by leveraging a powerful combination of OpenCV for advanced image processing, SymPy for robust symbolic mathematics, and Streamlit for a sleek and interactive web interface. This project showcases custom implementations of Canny edge detection and Hough Line Transform, ensuring precise edge and line detection, while also integrating NumPy for efficient numerical operations. The intuitive web interface allows users to effortlessly upload images and view results in real-time
